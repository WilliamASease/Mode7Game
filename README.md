# Mode7Game
A game in Java Swing that uses affine transformations to display an image with a 3D effect.
This is only the code. Some "Game files" are too large for Github.
I don't really intend on finishing the game, but have enjoyed creating the structures someone would need to do so.
I'll compile and upload a video of the game being played at some point.
